# A New Coding/Encoding Algorithm using Fibonacci numbers

### Introduction
This is a project i've implemented for my Advanced Algorithms Course based on this paper: "A New Coding/Encoding Algorithm using Fibonacci numbers".

### Implementations
Project is on python and separated into two sections, encoding and decoding. the algorithm for enc/dec is perfectly presented in the mentioned paper using 2 examples. <br/>
but the implementation of the paper is on MATLAB and coded statically which for different string sizes, changes need to be made on the code. my implementation is dynamic all the way. <br/>
also for implementing the fibonacci number, i've used Dynamic Programming. the benefit of it is for when the number passed to it's method is more than 30 or so which the time increases exponentially, which with DP it becomes almost Linear. <br/>
the project is completely modular, each step mentioned in the paper is in a separated module which makes the project more understandable and scalable.
